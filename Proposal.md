## Project Title : Analysis of the impact of lockdown on the air quality.

### Project Proposal:
### Introduction: 
   Our lives as we know it has come to a standstill over the last couple of months. The pandemic has curtailed most of our activities and forced us inside our own houses. While the whole situation at the moment seems rather bleak, all isnâ€™t lost. It has been clear that the lack of human interaction with the outside world has led to a positive impact on the environment. There have been reports of bluer skies, blooming flora and animals returning back to their habitats. 
   Our aim is to rationalize these claims and find any evidence to support it by comparing the data on the quality of air before and after the implementation of the lockdown in Europe. On the basis of our findings we would be formulating 2 predictive models and making comparisons on the possible trends in the air quality.

#### Description of the goals:
   We will be analyzing the data on the basis of the levels of NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 to make 2 predictive models, one that is based on the assumption that there was no lockdown and the other based on the current environmental data. The predictions made would then further be compared to make relevant conclusions on the status of the particulate pollution.

#### Instruments used:
   We would be using correlation matrices, scatterplots, heatmaps, histograms, linear regression and correlation to make our analysis.

#### Milestone 1:
   Compiling and formatting our data to categorize it into pre and post lockdown, filtering the data so that we are left with the relevant pollutants for our study and analyzing the data graphically.

#### Milestone 2:
   Identifying the factors that affect the air quality based on the collected data. The correlation between the pollutants can be interpreted via heatmaps.
